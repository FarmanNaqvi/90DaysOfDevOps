#90DaysOfDevOps (Day 2)
Task # 1 : Check your present working directory.
To check you present working directory in linux inside your terminal is "pwd". For Example, if you
are in your Downloads folder and you type 'pwd' in terminal it will gives you the whole path to 
access downloads folder. As you can see below, to access Downloads folder first you need to access
Home Directory > User account (in this case it's farman) > Downloads.

Task # 2 : List all the files or directories including hidden files.
Likewise in MS DOS if you want to see your files within the specific directory you can type DIR,
Similarly, if you want to see or check the list of files and folder you can type 'ls', However 'ls'
will only going to show you those files and folders which are visible and not hidden. TO view all files
and folders (including hidden items) you can use command 'ls -a'

Task # 3 : Create a nested directory A/B/C/D/E
In linux the folders are called directories, if you want to make a directory you can type mkdir which
will create a directory (folder) for you on the same location. If you want to create a hierarchy of 
directories like Downloads > Movies > Indian Movies, you can make these directories only with one 
command in linux which is 'mkdir -p Downloads/Movies/Indian Movies'.
