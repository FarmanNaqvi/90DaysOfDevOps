Task 1 : Explain in your own words and examples, what is Shell Scripting for DevOps.

Shell scripting is a file with set of command to automate any task which you wants to run frequently,
For Example, you are a Manager in a company and you have to run a Production report on daily basis
at the end, with the help of scripting you can automate this task instead of extracting a file
manually.

Task # 2 : Write a Shell Script which prints `I will complete #90DaysOofDevOps challenge`

Here is the script: 

#!bin/bash
echo "I will complete #90DaysOofDevOps challenge"

Task # 3 : Write a Shell Script to take user input, input from arguments and print the variables.

take a user input : You can use read command to take a input from a user.

input from arguments: you can place an argument while you are running a script, 
e.g ./script.sh first-argument and then in a file you can type $1 to print your first argument.

Print the Variable: To print a variables in shell script you can type ${variable name}.

Task 4: Write an Example of If else in Shell Scripting by comparing 2 numbers
Below mention is the script in which we will take a number from user and check if the number is 
positive or negative.

#!/usr/bin/bash

echo " ***** Script to Check if the number is possitive or negative "

read -p "Enter a number: " num
 

if [ $num -ge 0 ]
then
 echo "It is a positive number "
