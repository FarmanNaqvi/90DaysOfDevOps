#90DayofvDevops Challange
Day 1
Task 1 : Fork the repo, so here is my repo https://github.com/FarmanNaqvi/90DaysOfDevOps
Task 2 : Watch the Devops Roadmap video: Done
Task 3 (a) : What is Devops ?
Answer :  DevOps is a culture or methodology in which 2 departments (Operations and Development) works
together. Therefore the name of this methodology is a combination of Dev & Ops. Let's Suppose a 
developer write code, to make sure if the code is Scalable, Well Tested and deployed on the cloud,this
is the responsibility of a Devops Engineer. To Ensure above mention things, a Devops Engineer requires
some tools like AWS, Git, Puppet, Docker, Kubernetes etc. These tools are the combination of practices
to work faster than a tradional software devlopment, testing and delpoyment processs.

What is Automation ? 
DevOps automation is the tool to avoid repeatations of a similar work and to reduce human efforts.
Its also save your time and you can also apply the same task to thausands of servers in one click.
Also the automation tools for CI/CD which is Jenkins gives an edge to the teams to accelerate the
the software development process.

What is Scaling
Scaling in DevOps is use to increase or decrease the cloud computing resources as per your needs which
will save your money and prevent to waste your cloud computing resources. There are some tools, load
balancers available for Devops like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm etc. DevOps need to design their application
which has to be Scalable.

What is Infrastrcture
DevOps is an important part of infrastructure management. It covers a variety of techniques for 
managing the infrastructure through coding. Infrastructure itself is the IT environment which supports
applications or services, and can consist of servers, databases, networks, or other components.
To meet the needs of their applications, DevOps teams strive to manage their infrastructure 
automatically and scalably; employing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is one popular way to do 
this as it allows teams to automate the management process.

Why DevOps is important ?
DevOps is a key component of the software development and operations process as it allows for quicker
product launches and smoother maintenance of existing deployments. The primary objective of DevOps
is to create an efficient infrastructure for certain applications and ensure great scalability.
In essence, scalable applications are dependable, automated, and essential in today's software 
development cycle.
